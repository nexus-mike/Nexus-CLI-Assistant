New chat GPT Garlic is insane. This leaked AI model from OpenAI is beating Gemini 3 and Claude. Here's what's happening OpenAI declared code red. Why? Because Google's Gemini 3 just took over. Chat GPT usage is dropping. People are switching. An OpenAI knows they're losing, so they built Garlic, a secret model that's reportedly beating Gemini 3 and Claude Opus 4.5 in internal tests. Here's what makes it insane. It's faster than Gemini 3. It's cheaper to run, and it's just a smarts and giant models. Garlic uses high density pre-training, same knowledge, smaller model, way faster to use. It crushes encoding and reasoning, launchers early 2026 maybe sooner. This is the AI war heating up, and when these companies compete, we win.
